   The decoder is templated on the FST type and the token type.  The token type
   will normally be StdToken, but also may be BackpointerToken which is to support
   quick lookup of the current best path (see lattice-faster-online-decoder.h)

   The FST you invoke this decoder with is expected to equal
   Fst::Fst<fst::StdArc>, a.k.a. StdFst, or GrammarFst.  If you invoke it with
   FST == StdFst and it notices that the actual FST type is
   fst::VectorFst<fst::StdArc> or fst::ConstFst<fst::StdArc>, the decoder object
   will internally cast itself to one that is templated on those more specific
   types; this is an optimization for speed.

  // but every, say, 10 to 40 frames might make sense) it will spread out the
  // work of determinization over time, which might be useful for online
  // applications.
  //
  // The procedure of incremental determinization is as follow:
  // step 1: Get lattice chunk with initial and final states and arcs, called `raw
  // lattice`.
  // Here, we define a `final arc` as an arc to a final-state, and the source state
  // of it as a `pre-final state`
  // Similarly, we define a `initial arc` as an arc from a initial-state, and the
  // destination state of it as a `post-initial state`
  // The initial states are constructed corresponding to pre-final states in the
  // determinized and appended lattice before this chunk
  // The final states are constructed correponding to tokens in the last frames of
  // this chunk
  // Since the StateId can change during determinization, we need to give permanent
  // unique labels (as olabel) to these
  // raw-lattice states for latter appending.
  // We give each token an olabel id, called `token_label`, and each determinized and
  // appended state an olabel id, called `state_label`
  // step 2: Determinize the chunk of above raw lattice using determinization
  // algorithm the same as LatticeFasterDecoder. Benefit from above `state_label` and
  // `token_label` in initial and final arcs, each pre-final state in the last chunk
  // w.r.t the initial arc of this chunk can be treated uniquely and each token in
  // the last frame of this chunk can also be treated uniquely. We call the
  // determinized new
  // chunk `compact lattice (clat)`
  // step 3: Appending the new chunk `clat` to the determinized lattice
  // before this chunk. First, for each StateId in clat except its
  // initial state, allocate a new StateId in the appended
  // compact lattice. Copy the arcs except whose incoming state is initial
  // state. Secondly, for each initial arcs, change its source state to the state
  // corresponding to its `state_label`, which is a determinized and appended state
  // Finally, we make the previous final arcs point to a "dead state"
  // step 4 (optional): We re-determinize the appended lattice if needed.
